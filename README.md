# Hey, I'm Nicholas 👋

Co-Founder & CTO at [Onix](https://onixai.ai), building Personal Intelligence.

I work on human-system collaboration: how people and intelligent systems work together. That's been the thread through my career. From my Ph.D. in human-robot interaction, to deploying humanoid robots at [1X](https://1x.tech), to scaling industrial 3D printers at [AON3D](https://aon3d.com), to human-in-the-loop AI at [SmartOne.ai](https://smartone.ai/), to what we're building now at Onix.

Co-founded [AI Salon Montréal](https://www.aisalon.ai/). Mentor at Creative Destruction Lab and Next AI Montréal.

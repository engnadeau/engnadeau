# Nicholas Nadeau, Ph.D., P.Eng.

I began in biomedical design, developing surgical robots, brain implants, and cognitive neuroscience imaging and stimulation devices. 
This foundation led me to engineering leadership at AON3D (YC W17), where we built high-performance 3D printers for aerospace and defence. 
Seeing parts created by our systems end up on the International Space Station and even the Moon is a legacy I’m incredibly proud of.

Later, as CTO of 1X (formerly Halodi Robotics), I led teams pioneering humanoid robots for security applications and human-robot collaboration. 
From AI development to hardware engineering, we tackled the real-world deployment of robots in high-stakes environments. 
These experiences reinforced my belief in the potential of robotics and AI to reshape industries and interactions.

My journey then brought me into startup advisory and leadership. 
I founded a fractional CTO consultancy, Nadeau Innovations, collaborating with hard-tech startups and corporate innovation teams. 
When SmartOne.ai acquired this consultancy, I joined as CTO to lead AI-driven data transformation during the global AI boom.

I founded Transcension AI, focusing on expert consulting engagements in AI and emerging technologies and technical due diligence for VC investments. 
I’ve also co-founded a stealth startup dedicated to placing data sovereignty in the hands of individuals and fueling the next generation of ethically sourced, high-quality AI data. 
In parallel, I serve as Co-Founder of the AI Salon’s Montréal Chapter, connecting Québec’s AI startups with global investors to drive funding, collaboration, and growth.

Mentorship remains close to my heart. 
Whether through programs like Creative Destruction Lab or Next AI, I love working with founders and emerging talent, helping shape the next wave of tech innovation. 
I’ve also been humbled to be recognized within my local startup community for my contributions.

With a Ph.D. in robotics and AI, my passion lies in creating systems that amplify human potential—through physical robots or AI agents. 
Let’s connect if you share a vision for transforming how humans and intelligent systems collaborate—I’m always excited to meet people working on bold ideas.
